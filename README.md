# Uber Clone: 

what was the goal: 
-Build a functional Uber ride-share application which incorporates Redux, Google Maps API, Google Distance Matrix, Google Places, GraphQL, Stripe, and AWS Amplify. 
-Utilize Tailwind CSS to offer high-end styling to match the branding of the company. 
-Add animation and interactions to the application to ensure a smooth user experience. 

This application is a test of personal skills to show that I am able to build high-end mobile applications with top-quality design standards in just a matter of days. 


# Running the app: 

-be sure to install the node modeles. 
-add a .env file with the key "GOOGLE_MAPS_APIKEY:YOURKEYHERE"
the key must have access to Places, Distance Matrix, and Maps. 

run using "expo start"
